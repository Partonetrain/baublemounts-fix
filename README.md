This is a quick-and-dirty fix to a serious bug in [Bauble Mounts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bauble-mounts) that causes [mounts to be absorbed into ANY item](https://github.com/ShadowKing21228/Bauble-Mounts/issues/8). 
If this happens, your mount is essentially lost, because there's no way for regular items to convert the component back into a mob.
No more losing your prized max-speed horse to a regular item you accidentally clicked it with!
*This mod intentionally only works with Bauble Mounts 1.1.3a-1.21.1, so that when the author of Bauble Mounts updates their mod to fix this, this mod will become unnecessary.*
